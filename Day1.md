First day at Surf Board Payments

It was a sudden joining for me at Surf Board Payments. On the first day as the first thing, I did was an
interview, where only after I came to know that it was an interview that I give. That itself was a very
cool sets of conversation. Even I brought my Resume and Certificates with me, that too wasn’t
needed.
Then we had a meeting with Abraham the co-founder, The first thing he asked with us, was about
how we replied to the interviewer’s question “tell me about yourself?”, Yeah mine was “I am
Mohamed Ameen Javahar, Coming from Kerala, Kollam… etc.”
Abraham sir pointed out a thing which really strikes me on the session, that every intern including
me replied the place where we come from after our name. Which in the case saying our Native Place
for that question does not really help us or simply it doesn’t matter.
Yeah, we all know what we said was a mistake but we didn’t prepare to say like that. Then why?
We were taught to do so. By whom? Our Education System. That was the first lesson I had from
Abraham Sir.
Made me very interesting to attend further. He kept asking “What we learned from Schools?”. Many
replied How to Read, Write, do Math, Respect others etc. etc. All that was necessary but really that
doesn’t make us skill full.
Then he suggested us everyone to buy and start reading a book “Ownership”.
After an interesting session with Abraham sir, we had our lunch. Here on Surf Board Payments as an
intern we all are allocated to one-on-one mentor for me it was Joel, who was also my Senior at
college. He really helped me by reminding that this is the point in my life, which I should take this
internship very serious and he shared his experience working with Surf Board.
Then we all grouped up for a Round table meeting where all the team members as-well-as interns
gathered. It’s the first time I am attending in a meeting. Which this is done in all weeks mostly by
Monday’s. Where here Every one will talk about their focus for the week and what they are doing
now, when they are expected to finish their work etc.
After the meeting Joel, my mentor he asked me to write a report of the meeting which we had now.
With including all the details like what everyone’s focus of the week, what they did all that in a
format. Which I didn’t know how to do that. Obviously, I asked him for help, He told me to google it
like what’s a meeting report and find the correct format for it. After research I sorted that out but
then only, I realized I didn’t take any scribble notes from the meeting itself, which I should have
taken because it took me a while remember all the things said by team like their work and all.
So, I thought to finish that report for tomorrow and we had another session, here every one of us
received a laptop and told that this lap you are having does not installed a GUI, where we learned to
install a GUI which was really interesting. What made it interesting was, they didn’t teach us the
whole process of installing. They asked us to google it. Felt confused why they are kept on asking us
to google all things. But this is the thing I don’t know to google a thing in proper way or in the right
way. Our task was to install CENTOS. But my searches are not leading me to the correct page. Then
the trainer shows me to google that in the proper way. Yes, now I am on the page. I got it. Did some
scrolling and found the correct process, yes after spending some time I’ve managed to install
CENTOS for myself. Felt great. Really Made me happy.

Finishing off with the day Joel asked me to take any book from the library they have. I was confused
because I am not having this reading habit. So, Joel and Anoop helped me to choose a book “Journey
to the Centre of Earth” and ask me to read this book on a daily basis and report of reading should be
send to Joel as-well.
I learned a lot, I met new people and I’m going to have a new habit.
