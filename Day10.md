## Day 10 

### Session on Algorithm, solution by Sriram.

**Algorithm** An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.
Already we were given 3 algorithm problems. Our assignmnent was to find solution for each problem and to note down the steps we used.

> Helping Harry Potter to buy a new brromstick
**Solution I did.**
  
  For Harry Potter problem. I wrote down the constrains one by one. Contraints left with multiple solutions. So I started to wrote down the all the steps that took by 
  harry. First Converted *knuts* to *galleons* and *sickles* to *galleons*. Total galleons we had was 5000 which is 290 galleon value. 5000 knuts which has 10 galleon value.
  Then, made calculations on how harry would have spend the money for broomstick. The broomstick only cost 25 galleons. And he should spend more knutrs than sickles and only one-by-third part from his galleon collection.
  So, taking all that I did wrote the steps.
  
  **Solution Sriram did.** 
    His solution was also mostly same to me. Only the calculation part part was different. I felt like he used more steps for calculation. But the steps he wrote was very clear to understand.

> Helping Chandler for buying table.
**Solution I did.**

  Chandler's problem was a bit different from the previous one. Here it was to choose a table from the list. And she had many requirements to meet before choosing one.
  What I did was Eliminating items from the list on a ROUND basis. In 0th Round, 2 items were eliminated. Eliminated items which is not satisfiying the requiremnet. So by that I can able to short the list. On next ROUND which is 1st ROUND I eliminated items on bais of
  giving powers to the constraints. Like I given 3* power to the 1st requirement and only 2* power to 2nd requirement. Their selection on table can differ if they concentrates more on 1st requirement *The Table should be cheap*.
  
  So I had 3 answers based upon my solution.
  
  **Solution Sriram did.**
    Same as last time his calculation was different. Took more steps. He went on taking average on each items. And then wrote the steps.
 
> Helping Tom to find the shortest path.
**Solution I did.**

  I started breaking down the steps from finishing point to start point. My steps was to took each path and calculate the total distance. Each time I finish a route path. I Keep the total distance and if the second path
  takes more distance I'll cancel that particular step. If a shortest path is found I'll that short path as my prior path. By that I could managed to find the shortest path.
  
  **Solution Sriram did.**
    Sriram did the break down by taking all the possible steps and adding the total distance and then He sorted the shortest path. But that took many time and lot calculations were happend.
    
    
 **Algorith will have different steps. But all will lead to the solution.**
