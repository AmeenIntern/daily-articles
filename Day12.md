### Day-12


#### PPT
2nd week product presentation.

On this presentation I was more concentrated on UX of my app. I wanted to include all the features and options within lesser pages.
> Proccess I did was
  
  - **For Employee**
  - Noted down all the requirements from both employer and employee.
  - Wanted to add need? feature
  - options where employees can add each bills
  - view their profile
  - overview on their previous reimbursements
  
  - **For Admin** 
  - Able to view others need? feed
  - Accept or Reject bills
  - View each employees Rimbursements
  - Generate a pdf file for the same
  
  I went on creating 2 different apps. One for employee and other for employer.
  I added all the features mentioned abvove with in the app.
 
#### Wireframing

For giving an idea on how my app looks, I started doing wireframe. I used Balsamiq software.
Balsamiq Cloud is a web-based user interface design tool for creating wireframes (sometimes called mockups or low-fidelity prototypes). 
You can use it to generate digital sketches of your idea or concept for an application or website, to facilitate discussion and understanding before any code is written.

> I  learned on how to use the software.
- How to add text feild
- Add buttons
- symbols
- layouts
- icons
- Photos

There were many feature on the software, which I felt very confortable by using the software.
Then I added the wireframe Designs which I made, to my ppt presentation.


#### Product Presentation

I went nervous on presenting. 
I managed to explain all in detail. But there were flaws in my work.
Which I was not aware of the actual proccess happening in reimbuhhersement. 
Now understanding all the proccess, I want to rebuild my app again with showing a proper flow.
And my this time my ppt was also not better looking.

   **The proccess I thought was**
- An employee will send a bill to admin
- One of the admin will checks whether to accept or not
- then the accepted bill will be send to Evanjeline (The finance head) as pdf format.

  **The actual Proccess is**
- A bill is send by employee
- Each bill will undergo 3 filtering stages
- At first Askin will review the bill (stage 1)
- Send it to Abraham  (stage 2)
- He will review the same
- Send it to Evanjeline (stage 3)
- Where Evanjeline decides on how much of the amount should be repaid.
- And then the Reimbursed amount is reflected or added to the Employee's pay-slip.
  

The whole proccess itself was different. So the App which I made doesn't meet all the needs.
Now I want to figure how to add these steps. And the app should be very clear and Easy to understand by user as-well.


> **What I Learned.**
- For giving a good user experience the app shouldn't be having few pages. It can have many pages too. The key thing is,The user could able to understand
each steps. 
- Should devolope Interacting skills. I struggled a lot for making the panel to understand. So next time my presntation should have a good flow.
- PPT should be in a step by step proccess. where without saying itself, the panel should able to understand the proccess by seeing.
- Without understanding the behind process/requirements, never start to build or design any app.
