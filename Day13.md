### Day 13

#### FLUTTER BASICS

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, desktop, and embedded devices from a single codebase. 
Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

However, Flutter is not a programming language. It’s a software development kit (SDK) with prewritten code, consisting of ready-to-use and customizable widgets, 
as well as libraries, tools, and documentation that together serve to build cross-platform apps. Flutter’s language for cross-platform development is Dart, 
which was also developed by Google. 

> What I learned
Ijust learned basics of flutter like, 
- How to Break down UI using flutter.
- Started seperating each containers
- Get an idea on how containers are alligned
- Row and Column
- widget class
- containers
- child, children

I did a small break down on an sample UI image.
by doing the break down,I got to know how to think logically before coding.

#### DEMO MEET

In Demo Meet, I went on doing product presentation. This time on presenting I was more focused on User Experience. 
More the work I done for the week was wireframing. I wanted to show a clear picture on how my app works.
And I explained everything in detail. 

*I was not aware of the actual proccess happening in reimbuhhersement. 
Now understanding all the proccess, I want to rebuild my app again with showing a proper flow.*

**The actual Proccess is**
- A bill is send by employee
- Each bill will undergo 3 filtering stages
- At first Askin will review the bill (stage 1)
- Send it to Abraham  (stage 2)
- He will review the same
- Send it to Evanjeline (stage 3)
- Where Evanjeline decides on how much of the amount should be repaid.
- And then the Reimbursed amount is reflected or added to the Employee's pay-slip.

The whole proccess itself was different. So the App which I made doesn't meet all the needs.

This time I planned to finish the app one by one.
Now for the next presentation, I will be showing Employee app. 
I'm planning to present the UI of employee app.
