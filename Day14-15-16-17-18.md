### 4th week of internship.

Many things have to be finished. I was planning to give a completed UI work for my mobile app that I was working. So, I begin to learn about figma then started to research more about UI and UX. This was the hardest work I done for the week. Constructing app with good UI/UX. 
Even I spent more of my time thinking on how to include all my app features, that a user can easily understand at a glance. So, I googled read many articles related to UX. But nothing helped me, only confused me more.
So, I approached a different way. I went on using different apps already have in my phone. I tried to do a break down. Apps like Zomato, Whatsapp, Google pay. 
Went on digging every feature of the app, positions of the buttons, how a user’s purpose is met, user’s journey. Everything literally everything had a meaning and reason. Everything was arranged on purpose. I really got fascinated. I don’t know why. 
The answers I was looking for, was actually in front of me. Everything happening in an app had a reason to say. I gone through many popular apps that we use daily. Given me a good idea on how UI and UX differ. 
UI is nothing but the thing we see. Visual appearance. Where UX is the part, we don’t consciously notice each time but really have a reasonable purpose for everything. And those will only understand if we do a double check.
And one other thing really helped me was self-questioning. This is the core thing, which I wanted to develop in future also. Self-questioning helped me to improve my app’s efficiency a lot. 
Then the things were easy. I get finished building my app.

In between Abraham anna gave us a task on **“Abstracting lift”**. The lift, we had in our office building. Many things in a lift are fixed for a reason and on purpose. 
The buttons to access the floor are fixed in right side of the lift, because majority are Right-handed. The lift we use is limited to 8 persons max. It was not because of the maximum weight it can carry, It is because the lift is small enough to fit 8 people at time. 
Ceiling, the flooring, handle bars at each side, alarm button, stop button, Emergency light. Everything had a purpose to meet.

My perspective of thinking and visualising have changed a lot. The cultural meetings are also arranged on this purpose, I think. To change our perspective. 

### Wednesday, the presentation day.

This time I wanted to give the presentation in a much simpler way. I wanted to make everyone in the room to understand about UI and UX. 
Giving a visual representation is the way I chosen. I got a great example to explain the same. 
Heinz Ketchup bottle. There were two ketchup bottles made by Heinz. Where both the bottles are actually good to see. Alias having a good UI but the user experiences each bottle offer is different. 
Bottle A will make the user much effort to use and Bottle B gives much more easier user experience. I took that as an example to add in the presentation.

I was very prepared actually, The Figma design is done, PPT is done.
But as always, I was very nervous. I don’t know why. So, I spend some time on reading a book called “Extreme Ownership”.
I don’t have a habit of reading books, but Anna told us to start reading this book as this was a part of internship program. So, at least for that sake I started reading the book. I went on few pages; 
There were two US navy officers’ part of a SEAL operation. One was a ground army commander and leader. Now the two officers are in a situation, where they tried chasing a person in Iraq and then they suddenly surrounded by some armed enemies. 
Two versus Six. US officers are now outnumbered, they had less Ammo, and its even night. No other external helps. The situation is very bad and crucial. 
There is no second chance for him. He has to make a right decision; were anything could go wrong if he fails to take the right call. So, this time he owned the power to lead that situation. He went stern and steady on each action he made. They countered all the enemies with a good strategy. They managed to escape from the scene.
Wow, the courage to take the responsibility by the officer was really great and made me feel very relax. Presentation started, Yet I was nervous but I had no choice left. I wanted to give a good presentation. Somehow, I should overcome my fear, this time I should own the lead. 
Don’t know what happened, last week on presenting I couldn’t able to reach my points to the panel, this time I was able to explain everything in detail. Even everyone in the room was happy. 


### What I learned and understood so far. 

Each thing in our internship program is set for a reason. 
Take the book itself, wow It really gave me a power. A power that made me feel, I own the app. So, I’m the man who should be responsible to clear all the mistakes and to defend any questions if raised. 
Take the Abstract task. That too really helped me in breaking down each thing. Helped me in creating the UI/UX.
This will be a memorable week for me. In a slow pace the internship programme is building a value in me, my priorities, my perspective on how to see the things around me. 
As I always say to myself. **“A change is just around the corner”**. And for me Surfboard is the path around the corner.
