Day-2 on Surf Board Payments

My day Started by a meeting with Abraham sir. He doesn’t like to call him sir. Where today we were
about to start a learning session on Problem Solving. Okay, that felt interesting for a minute But the
Question raised, what’s meant by the word Problem.
Yeah, everyone on the room went mute. But why? I asked myself for a moment.
“I know about problems; I am having many problems. That’s the only thing I am having, thinking too
much, what to do next blah blah.”
Many come up with interesting answers. He noted everything on a white board point to point and
then erased it. None of them was correct.
Problem Solving - something which have certain constraints to be followed to do a task, where the
solution must be of satisfying all the constraints without failing.
He taught us how to find a problem in steps,
1, Understand the problem
2, List the constraints
3, List all the possible operations
4, Arrange possible operation
Had a beautiful session of understanding a problem and ways to find. It was very interactive session
with end of the morning session we given a Number Slide Puzzle to solve, to find a strategy to solve
it and make a note how it’s done and should do it in minimum steps.
Spent a good time solving it. Meanwhile I faced a real problem, where the laptop which I installed
with CENTOS can’t able to do log-in. It was showing Password Incorrect. Then I get help from my
mentor to solve that particular problem of mine.
Then I wanted to finish a work which I left over yesterday, to complete the meeting report. Again, I
went to my problem solver Joel, my mentor. This time he asked me to go and ask with all the team
who attended the meeting and ask them about their focus on this week.
Yeah, I went and ask with everyone of the team and had a talk about their works, what they work
on. Some were working on Mobile app, Web, Designing. Going and talking to everyone made me feel
comfortable.
So finally, I was able to finish the report. I showed to Joel there was some mistakes here and there.
He corrected it. Yeah, and it went well.
After lunch, Abraham sir was in a rush but he asked to interns anyone had done with their puzzle. No
one raised their hands but only me. I figured out a strategy of solving it, He called me inside the
meeting room and I started to explain. But that was not the correct strategy he was expecting. But
somehow, I managed to come near to it. So, he told good work you where thinking on the right way.
That also felt great.

Then he explained how it should be done and trick also he showed. After that he told some number
slide puzzle can’t be solved. But me on the other hand argued it with, I can solve with my strategy.
He simply replied to google and check with that. Yeah, I was wrong again.
Wrapping up the session he gave us much more complicated 5*5 puzzle to solve. Hopefully I believe
that I can solve this. But at least I want to give a try.
So by all that interesting things, Today also went well.
