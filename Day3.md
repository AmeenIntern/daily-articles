Day 3
30-09-2021

Today soon after the breakfast, we interns were separated to 3 groups. I was in Sriram anna’s group.
He walked us in through, how to design a login page. Then he randomly selected an image from
google for a sample login page and we done a break down for that page. Like which had basic things,
a welcome title, username, password, and a button for sign-in. We noted all those down and he
started to do the coding in flutter. Which was new to me, I haven’t heard that before, he was
continuing with the coding for a while. Which felt boring because I didn’t understand.
But after finishing the login page, he explained to us the whole thing. Like what all he did, what all
fonts he used, the text color. How he copied those attributes from a page to here. All felt interesting.
After the session I asked him about flutter and how should I start to learn flutter. He explained me
well. He given a website where, I can learn by videos and there were articles related to the same.
Then I shared Yesterday’s assignment works to Joel, He asked me to send it via mail. I just attached
the word file and send those to him. He read everything and told me, next time while sending a mail
do it in a proper way, by adding subject and with a proper format.
Abraham anna came in for morning meeting. This time he showed us a sudoku puzzle in the screen
and asked us which is the easiest place to fit a number. Without thinking a moment, I replied “It’s
the Centre”. Yeah, the answer was right. I knew it because I used to solve sudoku back in days. The
reason why its Centre is because mostly every number in the middle square will be filled and its easy
to find which number left.
Abraham anna also agreed to the same. And he added, Centre is the portion which is having more
constrains that’s why it was easy to figure it out.
So, he told to remember that which is having more constraints will be the easiest thing to solve first.
Yeah, that helped me in the next puzzle he given.
The next puzzle was a bit confusing, but went very easy to solve by applying the technique he told.
And I wrote down every constraint in the puzzle and arranged it in an order. That makes me to
understand the puzzle well.
Between, Abraham anna told us to break down any mobile app like instagram, swiggy etc. Where if
there’s a sign-up page what all should be there. To find and sort all functions of buttons, etc.
After the lunch Joel bro gave me another task to study on how to use vi in terminal and learn about
vi and for what it’s used. I googled it and Askin bro also explained to me as well.
All of sudden, Abraham anna made a quick meeting, we all gathered. He started to present his
screen by saying, this will be the weirdest meeting I’m going to conduct. We went curious, the
screen turned on with a title “How to use a Toilet”. Every one including me went to laugh. He
continued explaining like how to sit in the proper way with image slides too.
The reason why is, he was getting a lot of complaints lately on unhygienically leaving the restroom.
But the way he cared to explain was very interesting. That felt like a good strategy of him, to deal
with this “problem”.

As wrapping today’s session, I was left with doing an assignment on helping Joel bro to build a
Reimbursement App for the Employers. He filled me with a structural idea like, how the app should
be, what all functions should be there etc.
So yeah, today also went well.
