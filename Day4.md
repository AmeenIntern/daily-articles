DAY 4

Soon, reached office I changed my book "Journey to the Centre of Earth" with Jeff Bezo's "Everything Store".
The book telling how he started his jounrey etc. I did reading for a  long time, It felt very interesting to get know about him.
But no morning sessions were taken by Abraham anna, Some internet issues where facing on the day. So i kept reading for a while and Joel came in and
I started to explain about my assignment which he given back yesterday. To break down a Reimbursement app for the office.

I shared my thoughts on what all features should the app have like, I added the should be used by everyone so there should be a thing like post feature. Then i showed how the app should look etc. We then shared our thoughts on what all needed etc. I understand a lot of thinga like a Authentication should be added, we should choose a correct data base for our app, there are many database out there for many functions to serve like for a chatting app there should be a different one and for a e-commercial site, there should be a different. 

After we had a session with Askin anna where, he taught us how to use vi editor, and its functions, commands etc.
He started from really basics like explaining what vi used for and why vi is used here in surfboards.

Like earlier they were using vs code and they practiced to change using vi. Because vs code was more of like advanced editor which had extra features like detecting an error while coding itself etc. etc.
Learned many things like how to create a file, insert text, learned about buffer, how to get different buffer pages in same screen using split option.
It really helped me, even I'm assigned to do my assignment using vi.

After the session I made a research on google on, what database should we use for reumbursement app.Collected many informations like Authentication, multiple authentication access.

While browsing for a while, we had a Demo Meeting. Which usually get's conducted on Friday's. Every team will present their work so far using, screen slides. Here they share the problems they faced, How they approached, what all changes needed etc.

After the presentation, We interns asked to talk about our Experience with surfboard. I took the stage first by sharing all my experience so far.
Had face a starting problem, but I managed to talk about all the things like the way Joel helped me as a Mentor, and project we are working on "creating app for Reimbursement ". Felt great having the stage. 

The day wrapped with more learnings, Mistakes, Research and Reading.
Even this assignment I've typed is using vi. On Each step i learned many things like how to count whole words, How copy paste, save, quit, how to search for a line, a particular word. Practicing this method daily can, make a impact of mastering vi in me.
