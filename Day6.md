## Day 6

It was a rainy day. I was very tired as well beacuse the night before I had to do 2 assignments, one on Meeting report and the other was on Daily report. After writing those in .md file I had to upload the files to Github as well. 

Sreeram Anna were on leave today, so we didnt had our Employee App devolopment session. I used that time to edit my assigments and got comment from my mentor saying that I should improve my writing skills. And he assigned me to take a session with Anoop bro, who is working in the company as a technical writer. He guided me on, how to report.

He taught me on things like, the report should be written in steps. 10% research, 15% Drafting, 50% Editing, 15% Review, 10% Publication.
Research is the main thing that we should do before any writing because if we dont have idea on what writing, we cant even able to start. 

If we have resources on what writing then, We should think on how Drafting. Drafting will process like we decide on what should come first to how to end. I can be in a chronological order too. 

Editing is the part where we write all the drafted points. After completing it Read and review it. Check on any error, grammer mistakes etc.

I noted down all the points he told. Soon after we had a session with Abraham anna on puzzle solving. This time it was interesting he gived us a bridge puzzle to solve. There were 7 bridges in total connecting 4 islands. The question was to cross over all 7 bridges and should not visit a bridge again. 

The puzzle was very hard to get solved, but i tried a lot and figured out that solving this puzzle is not possible. I went on researching why its not possible to do.

Between Kaushik anna came in and gathered all interns and given everyone a stick note and asked us to give a feedback on what the things you like, What we dont like.

I wrote things like laptop issues, and wifi problem. There was nothing much like *unlike things*,I was way happy to be in here. I really enojoy to come here and learn new things.

After going to our accomodation I had to create the presentation ppt. I didnt had any idea on how the format should be. So I went calling my mentor, he helped me with some tips. Keeping all that in mind, I started creating ppt. It took me so long finishing it. I slept by 4 in the morning.

That was my day.
