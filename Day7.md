## Day 7

### The presentation day.

So this will be my first presentation giving in surfboard. I was very prepared with the ppt and went to office.

After reaching the office we all had to continue on the App devoloping session. I was not really ready to attend the session, because I was more worried on my ppt Because my ppt was very long had many slides. So I was keep on thinking wheather to reduce the slides or should i have to change anything. These were the things i kept on thinking. 

But only after the session i can make that change in ppt. So, I went attending the session, I was very tired as well because only few hours of sleep i did get.

Soon after finishing the session, I went to show the ppt from my personal laptop to my mentor. But he warned me again not to use personal laptops in office But I explained him the problem what I was facing with my laptop. The mouse cursor was not working.

But still he insisted me to use it. Then i went on showing my ppt, he was ok with it but, asked me to write it short. So I went to Anoop bro, He helped me in Reducing big sentences. He given me an idea on how a ppt should look like. He given me some tips like *Try to finish it with less number of slides and talk more on about presentation** keeping that on mind I started to cut-down the slides. 

Some how I manage to finish the ppt but in between I faced many problems with the laptop. 

Soon after that a qiuck intern meeting was there with Abraham anna, he went on reading our feedbacks that we given yesterday. Many of others feedback was funny because some listed on *mosquito problems*, other one was *AC is too cold*. Abraham anna commented on every single feedbacks. Even I added laptop probelm, that also he explained like he wanted us to learn by struggling. By doing every functions manually. 

Session over, also had luch, everyone is busy with their works, some where playing Table Tennis. 
I was simply sitting with nothing to do, But Every moment was like thinking on how should I present. This thinking was keeping me very worried. My Mentor told that I can have the presentation by 4pm. 

Done a double check over ppt. Made myself strong. The meeting started, Every other mentors was there in the room as well. I shared my screen to tv.

I started presenting, but i dont know whats happening to me, I was like stammering a lot, my hands went shivering. The whole confidence i Built was loosing by one at a moment. Some how i was able to finish the presentation. 

There was many flaws in my presentation, I took so long to finish, I thought everyone got bored of taking too much time.

But I had seen many happy faces. Everyone was happy with my presentation. I got many comments like ppt slides was good, colors, the clip arts i chosen for the slides. Everyone appreciated me on my work.

The presentation is over, I coundnt beleive, that I given a live presentation. I was still in a shock but deep inside I felt proud of myself. Soon leaving the meeting room I celebrated myself by having a Coffee.

On each sip I was thinking about the presentation, each appreciations I got from the panel. 
I was very happy. Very happy like no one in the office were happier than me.

So, The *worried me* to the *happy me* took so much work, time, dedication, and Belief in myself.

This day will always be my speacial day. I made myself to cross the limits.
This was the change I needed in my life and SurfBoard is the corner with right path.
