## DAY 8

#### We had a Morning session on Employee App Devolopement. Sreeram took the session. 

I learned lot of things like 
- **Token** An authentication token securely transmits information about user identities between applications and websites and application programming interfaces (APIs) without having to enter their login credentials each time they visit. Social media platforms will have a token validity of long time.
- **A Refresh token** is a string that represents an authorization that was granted to a client to use a particular set of web services on behalf of a user to access data. Once they expire, client applications can use a refresh token to "refresh" the access token. 
- **Added an alert messagge** learned on how adding a alert message, alert message was added for things like, if the user is not authenticated then the alert box will show alert like not registerd. or if a user given wrong password it will show wrong password, If user attemts to login too many times that also will show in alert message. It will show when the user last logged. 

**What I did learn** 
I really did'nt had idea on token at all. But then I ask with sriram anna and learned the relevant of the feature token. Because apps like instagram and yonosbi is totally different. In instagram we can be online for soo long because it,s a social medaia sharing platform. So if they ask to login in each time after we use, can make the users unconfortable.
Where in yonosbi, It's an app provided by a Financial bank offering users to manage their bank account, tranfer money, etc. Here we cant give a so long token validity,because of security issues. An unauthorised access or fraudulent problems can happen if the app reamains still open. So in this case a short validity of token should be given for the app.
I didn't even thought there should be a alert message box in our login. But that alert showing dialouge box can be very helpful. Because I itself face problems like entering wrong password in sites. But if that time, the app is not showing any warning message, then I cant get to know why is that because of. It might can be a username error or password. So showing correct notification can alert the user. While adding alert feature first we went on adding a pop-up screen, then sreeram anna told this could make the user mad. because each time a screen is coming on top of present screen not a good thing. So we went on choosing a float like box showing us the alert in bottom of the screen. By this way the user can view what's the problem in a glance.

#### Session on Algorithm conducted by Kaushik.
I learned a lot of things like.
- **Algorithm** An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.
- **Computer = Dumb** Computers are just a dumb machine. They are the undisputed chess champions of the world, but they can’t understand a simple English conversation. Even Computers can solve a very complex math problem but they cant give us a proper answer for a question like "what a grasshopper eat?".

**What I did learned** 
Algorithm are steps of instructions which we can formulate for any problem. Where there will be a certain constraints. If a human can able to crack one algorithm it does'nt mean that is the easiest way. There can be a different, more easier and shortest way. But a human to find easiest algorithm on a rubix cube will take so much time, even it will take years. So my undesrtanding is that, By giving the computer all the needed instructions and constraints then the computer can easily shows us the easiest algorithm.

#### Got lessons on how to write Daily article
Always should take notes on what did I learned on each day. And to write down all the important things in keywords, so that it will be easier for me when writing each day article. And In the article, there should be more things about what i learned rather than writing on what happened each day

That itself is used to having us a clear picture on what learned in the end. And setting a word limit of 1000 words will make us to learn more so only we will be able to write more.

#### Figma
Figma is a web-based graphics editing and user interface design app. You can use it to do all kinds of graphic design work from wireframing websites, designing mobile app interfaces, prototyping designs, crafting social media posts, and everything in between. 

- I learned on very basic things like how to create a frame (the space we work)
- How to add colors in background
- Add a text field
- transform any text or icons
- text fonts
- transparent layer with gradient colour
- pen tool
- other tools like rectangle, circle etc.
- how to give round shape to square
- creating buttons
- welcome messages
- allignment

Figma is a very useful and free platform which having an API. In both mac and windows can be used because its online editor. Its very useful for devolopers. I want to learn more on Figma.

#### UI/UX
The “UI” in UI design stands for “user interface.” The user interface is the graphical layout of an application. It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields, and all the rest of the items the user interacts with. This includes screen layout, transitions, interface animations. Any sort of visual element, interaction, or animation must all be designed.

UI designers decide on what the application is going to look like. They have to choose the color schemes and button shapes, the width of lines and the fonts used for text. UI designers create the look and feel of an application’s user interface.

A user’s experience or "UX" of the app is determined by how they interact with it. Is the experience smooth and interactive or hard and confusing?
UX designer decide on things like roadmap on which option leads to which. without a UX design the app can feel clumsy, example if we want to post a photo in instagram and take the process itself take 5 steps. Then the user experience goes really down. And slowly the starts to hate using the app.
