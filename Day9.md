### Day 9

#### UX
User experience is important because it tries to fulfill the user's needs. It aims to provide positive experiences that keep a user loyal to the product or brand. 

As for second week, my Product presentation on "Reimbursement App". I was concerned on Wire framing on each section of app. Like what all options the Homepage should have, With less pages.

As on researching more about UX, I came to a point like, Every user wont be expecting a less number of pages/steps in an app. For some options/reasons the app should have multiple pages.

So, having less number of pages can't assure it gives a good a user experience. Some times more number of pages are required to meet the solution.

##### The Mistake I've done.
**I was Straight away jumping to the solution.**, The requirement was to Create an app for Reimbursement. But I have not considerd more on Organisation's side, I was more concerned on how the employees can make use of the app.

So this made me to research more about REIMBURSEMENT proccess happeening on any organisation

#### Research on Reimbursement Process

The payments made by employees are considered eligible for expense reimbursements. Such monetary returns are repaid to employees to compensate for personal expenses they incurred in their performance of their job duties on behalf of their employer, and that is external to the calculation of their regular pay.

And Reimbursemnt process happening in all organisations are not same. Every company is having a different monetary policies, different time of repaying (some repays on monthly basis and others are subjected to weekly basis.), T&E policies, Some have a account session for managing bills they handle it in a different way,
some have a pre-approval request for each purchases.

So having a general app for every oraganisation is not possible, atleast the app should have different functions on each category of organisation. So I stick with a plan to build only an App for our company at *SurfBoard payments*.


**The end goal of expense reimbursement is to ensure that work-associated transactions are administered and settled with efficiency, accuracy, and accountability to the satisfaction of both the employer and the employee.**


On the employer side the app should have options for.
- Accountability
- Glance on which categories money is spending
- Determine what expenses the employees can claim
- Add a section for pre-approval claims

On the employee side the app should have for.
- need? option
- bill sending option
- category
- While sending the bill, all the feilds are recorded.
- waiting reply message
